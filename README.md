# React + Vite Front end 

This branch was accidently created but is not being used mostly for our front end. Using Vite + React, our front page will ask the user how they are feeling on request, 

Currently, three offical branches on our github, master is just a react and vite template while we work in this branch. 

There are also two plugins being used for the readme. 

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
