# Happy Or Sad
A small web app that will collect users data about their mood anonymously, displaying it on a map for all to see.

# OUR GOAL
As we move into the future, life only seems to get busier. While everyone is running around trying to save time and manage their busy lifestyles, people tend to connect and talk less about their mental heath. We want to fix that, our app will allow anyone to share how they are feeling with the world; allowing the user to also see the majority of feelings around the area, city or even globe. 

We hope that by connecting everyone with (currently ) three moods, this will let poeple know that they are not the only ones feeling this way. This app is planned with lonleyness in mind as we want users to feel as they're not alone, not matter the mood they're in.

# FUTURE PLANS
We hope to use the data collected for larger projects and also to benifit mental health services. If a therapy group knows that the majority of people are feelign down, they can interpert this into their lessons and help plan better and more heathier futures.

# About us
Currently working on this app is two close friends who are focused on making the world a better and happier place. While we both work full-time, this is only a side project and may not be updated consistently.
