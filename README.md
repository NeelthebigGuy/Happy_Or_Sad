# Happy_Or_Sad
A small web app that will collect users data about their mood anonymously, displaying it on a map for all to see.

# OUR GOAL
As we move into the future, life only seems to get busier. While everyone is running around trying to save time and manage their busy lifestyles, people tend to connect and talk less about their mental heath. We want to fix that, our app will allow anyone to share how they are feeling with the world; allowing the user to also see the majority of feelings around the area, city or even globe. 

We hope that by connecting everyone with (currently ) theer moods, this will let poeple know that they are not the only ones feeling this way.
